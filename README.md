## The Problem

The world is affected by the n-Cov virus and due to its highly contagious nature, many nations are forced to put their citizens under lockdown and confine them to their homes to curb this pandemic.

These people may also be compromising on the basic but important safety precautions advised by their respective health organistaions. All of these problems may lead to an unprecedented consequences and would hamper the whole initiative.
